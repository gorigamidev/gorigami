# Gorigami — Brand & UI Lineage

## 1. Brand Essence

**Gorigami** is a creative technology lab.
We believe the best systems are built by **small, focused teams** with strong craft,
clear thinking, and ownership.

Our work sits at the intersection of:

- software engineering
- product thinking
- visual clarity

**Core idea:**  
> Create & Innovate — small teams, big systems.

---

## 2. Brand Archetype

### **The Craft Lab**

- Not corporate
- Not agency-driven
- Not trend-chasing

We operate like a lab:

- we prototype
- we test
- we ship
- we refine

---

## 3. Logo & Logotype

### Primary Logo

The Gorigami logotype is based on a **custom-selected font** (used exclusively for the logo).

#### **Rules:**

- The logo font is **never used for body text**
- It is treated as a **brand mark**, not a UI font
- Do not modify proportions, spacing, or weight

### Usage

- Header (top-left)
- Footer
- Large editorial moments (hero, section breaks)

### Do Not

- Use the logo font for paragraphs
- Stretch or distort
- Apply shadows, gradients, or outlines

---

## 4. Typography System (UI & Content)

Typography is editorial, calm, and modern.
We separate **identity** (logo) from **readability** (UI).

### UI Typeface (Primary)

A clean, modern sans-serif for interfaces and content.

Used for:

- headings
- paragraphs
- navigation
- labels
- forms

**Tone:** neutral, confident, quiet.

### Typographic Hierarchy

- **Display text**
  - Very large
  - Few words
  - Used for concepts (`create.`, `innovate.`, `lab.`)

- **Headings**
  - Clear structure
  - Short phrases
  - Never verbose

- **Body**
  - Short paragraphs
  - Comfortable line-height
  - No marketing filler

- **Labels / Meta**
  - Uppercase
  - Small size
  - Wide letter-spacing

---

## 5. Color System

### Core Palette

- **Ink Black**
  - Used for text, structure, UI anchors

- **Paper White**
  - Main background
  - Creates space and calm

- **Gorigami Accent**
  - Brand highlight color (existing hex from current site)
  - Used sparingly

### Color Rules

- White ≈ 70%
- Black ≈ 25%
- Accent ≈ 5%

Accent color is only for:

- primary CTAs
- active states
- highlights
- key visual moments

If everything is highlighted, nothing is.

---

## 6. Layout & Grid

### Grid System

- Desktop: 12 columns
- Mobile: 4 columns

Layouts are structured but allow intentional breaks:

- text crossing columns
- vertical labels
- oversized words partially off-screen

Whitespace is a design element, not empty space.

---

## 7. Visual Language

### Imagery Style

Avoid:

- generic stock photos
- corporate smiling people
- cliché startup visuals

Preferred:

- abstract forms
- hands, tools, paper, folds
- cropped UI fragments
- blurred or stylized code
- black & white with accent overlays

### Motion

Motion is subtle and purposeful:

- folds
- slides
- fades
- reveals

No heavy parallax.
No gimmicks.

---

## 8. UI Components

### Buttons

- Minimal
- Strong contrast
- Square or slightly rounded

Examples:

- `→ Build`
- `→ Explore`
- `→ Start project`

Hover:

- small translation
- arrow movement
- no glow

### Cards

- White background
- Thin border or soft shadow
- One strong title
- One short description

### Labels

- Uppercase
- Small
- Used as anchors

Example:

```text
IN-HOUSE SYSTEM
KEEPERCASE
```

---

## 9. In-House Projects (Showcase Rules)

In-house systems are shown as **demos**, not full products.

Rules:

- No real data
- No client data
- No full system exposure

Formats:

- 5–10s looping videos
- UI fragments
- Controlled screen recordings

Purpose:
> Show capability, not implementation details.

---

## 10. Team Representation

The team is presented as a **small, focused group**.

Guidelines:

- Neutral or black & white portraits
- Strong cropping
- Calm expressions
- No corporate poses

Format:

- Name (prominent)
- Role (secondary)
- One short sentence max

---

## 11. Tone of Voice

- Confident
- Calm
- Precise
- Human

Avoid:

- buzzwords
- hype language
- empty promises

Preferred verbs:

- build
- craft
- fold
- design
- refine
- evolve

---

## 12. Guiding Principle

> Gorigami is not loud.
> Gorigami is intentional.

Every design decision should answer:
**Does this help us create and innovate with clarity?**

If not, remove it.
